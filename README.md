## <a id="description"></a>Description

This plugin is designed to automate routine and/or triggered jobs with Delphix Self Service Containers and Bookmarks. An example automation would be during a build phase, if some automated tests failed while running in a database, that Self Service Container could have it's current state bookmarked, and that bookmark could be shared with the rest of the team. It might also be required to refresh a development database from the production source during deployment. These are just a few examples of possible automations.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

Install through Jenkins Plugin Manager or download [here](https://plugins.jenkins.io/delphix).

## <a id="requirements"></a>Delphix Engine Requirements

Delphix Engine v6.0.0 or higher.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

#### Global Configuration

After the plugin has been installed, Delphix engines will need to be connected. Go to System Configuration page, scroll down to the Delphix section. Enter your Engine Address, Username, and password, then click "Test Connection". If Jenkins is able to reach the engine and log in, you will see a "Login Successful" reply message. If you wish to add multiple engines, click the "Add Engine" button for each engine you wish to connect to Jenkins.

#### Self Service Container

To interact with Self Service Containers, select "Delphix - Self Service Container" from the "Add Build Step" drop down in the Build phase section. Select an engine that was configured in the global configuration, select one of the operations listed below. Depending on the operation selected, it will either depend on a specified Self Service Container or a Bookmark. Read more about [Delphix Self Service Containers](https://docs.delphix.com/docs/delphix-self-service/delphix-self-service-admin-guide/understanding-data-containers).

Available Operations:

*   refresh
*   restore
*   reset
*   enable
*   disable
*   recover
*   undo
*   lock
*   unlock

#### Self Service Bookmark

To interact with Self Service Bookmarks, select "Delphix - Self Service Bookmark" from the "Add Build Step" drop down in the Build phase section. Select an engine that was configured in the global configuration, select one of the operations listed below. Depending on the operation selected, it will either depend on a specified Self Service Container or a Bookmark. Read more about [Delphix Self Service Bookmarks](https://docs.delphix.com/docs/delphix-self-service/delphix-self-service-admin-guide/understanding-bookmarks).

Available Operations:

*   create
*   delete
*   share
*   unshare

#### Advanced Settings

It is possible to share assets created between build steps. For instance, if you wanted to create a bookmark from a container and then restore a different container with the newly created bookmark. The create operation for both Self Service Containers and Bookmarks will have their output saved if the "Save to Properties" box is checked. The Self Service Container operation "restore" requires a Bookmark for reference. This Bookmark can be loaded a previous build step when "Load Bookmark from Properties" is checked. Likewise, the referenced Self Service Container in the Bookmark build step can be loaded from the properties file.
